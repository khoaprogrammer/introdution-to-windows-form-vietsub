Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and this module, which is part of our Introduction to Windows Forms course,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is on Binding to DataSets.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For this outline to make sense, I need to give you a very brief introduction to DataSets.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
DataSets are basically in-memory databases. So traditionally what we'll do is when our form loads,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we'll go to a database, get some data, and put it into the DataSet, then we'll data bind to the DataSet,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and make all of our changes in-memory, and at some point we'll kick off a Save operation, where we take all

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
of the changes we've made in-memory in the DataSet, and push them back into the underlying database.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With that foundation covered, we can now get back to our outline. We'll begin the module with a little bit

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
less brief introduction or primer on ADO.NET and DataSets, we'll see how we can populate DataSets from a

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
database, we'll take a look at how to data bind to DataSets, we'll see how to Add and Remove Rows in a

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
table in a DataSet, and finally how to save the changes we've made in the DataSet back to the database.
