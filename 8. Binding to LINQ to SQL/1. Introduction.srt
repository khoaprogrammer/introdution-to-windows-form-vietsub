Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and this module, which is part of our Introduction to Windows Forms course

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is on Data Binding with LINQ to SQL.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll begin the module with an introduction to LINQ to SQL and the main object in a LINQ to SQL module,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is the DataContext, and then we'll take a look at how to perform CRUD operations, that's Create, Read,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Update, and Delete, against a LINQ to SQL model.
