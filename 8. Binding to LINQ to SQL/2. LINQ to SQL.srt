00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this section we'll begin our look at LINQ to SQL. At a high level, LINQ to SQL is a layer that lives

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
between your application and a SQL Server database. Your application performs operations on LINQ to SQL

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it translates those operations into something that the database understands, and then it takes the

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
responses coming back from the database and converts those into something that your application understands.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now when I say your application communicates with LINQ to SQL, what I really mean is it communicates with a

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
logical model of the data in the database. The logical model is generated by the LINQ to SQL designer;

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we'll see the use of the designer in the upcoming demo. The model contains classes that represent the tables

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in your database, and it also contains classes that represent the rows in those tables.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
One of the ways our application can interact with LINQ to SQL is to perform a query on the object in the model.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
LINQ to SQL takes that query and converts it into a Select command on the database.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The database returns a set of rows to LINQ to SQL, and then LINQ to SQL turns those rows into objects of

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
types from the model. We can also make changes so we can change the property values in the objects that

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
represent the rows, or we can add or remove items from the objects that represent the tables.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then we can ask LINQ to SQL to send our changes back to the database, and LINQ to SQL will persist those

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
changes by issuing the appropriate commands to the database.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In addition to the classes that represent the tables and rows in the database, the LINQ to SQL designer also

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
generates a class called the DataContext. The DataContext really is the central object when we're working

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
with LINQ to SQL. Instances of classes that represent the tables come off the DataContext, the method we

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
call to submit the changes back to the database is off the DataContext, the DataContext manages connections

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to the database, it manages change tracking, and much more. There's more to discuss about the DataContext,

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but I'm going to reserve that discussion until after we've done the first set of demos, which we'll move to now.
