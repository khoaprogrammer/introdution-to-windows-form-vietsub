00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this demo we'll create our LinqSource class, implement the Get methods, and then setup our form so we can

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
bind to the new LinqSource. So I'll start by creating the class, I'll right-click on the project and choose

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Add-Class, I'll call this class LinqSource. I want this class to implement the ISource interface,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so Implements ISource, let me get into full screen. Now I want to add a field to represent our DataContext,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so Private _context As New NorthwindDataContext, and now I want to implement our two Get methods, so let me

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,000
just move those up to the top. For GetCategories, we'll just return the Categories entity,

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so Return _context.LinqCategories. So we have a LinqCategory entity in our model, and the designer

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
automatically added a LinqCategories collection to the context. So it took the name of the entity and

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
pluralized it to get the name of the collection. And now for the products, I want to do a query to get all

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the products in the category that's been passed in as a parameter, Dim query = From p In _context.LinqProducts

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where p.CategoryID = CategoryId we've been passing as a parameter, I want to Select p, and now I just want

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to Return the results of the query. Alright, so now that we have our Get methods, we can go modify the form

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to use them, so let me get out of full screen, and then open up the data form, and then go to the SourceComboBox,

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and modify its Items, so I want to add a new item, and this one is called LINQ to SQL, and click OK.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And now I want to go into the code for the form, so I'll right-click on the designer and choose View Code,

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and go into full screen, and I want to add a field for our LinqSource, so private _linqSource As LinqSource,

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and now I want to scroll down to where we set the source, here, and just add in a new Case in our Case statement.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And if this is 2, then I want to create a LinqSource, or check to see is the LinqSource Nothing, and if it

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:27,000
is then I want to set the LinqSource to a New LinqSource, and then I want to set the currentSource = _linqSource.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So because of the way we've implemented our form, that should be all that's required to get the data and

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
show it on the form, so let's press F5,

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and then let's change the source to LINQ to SQL, and then let's change the Category here to Confections,

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so there's our Confections, and our Produce, and our Seafood, and there's a Test item from the previous module,

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and I can scroll through these guys and get the data for the selected item, so that's working, and then our

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
last test was to come over to, I believe we've been using Outback Lager, and set the unit price to be 100,

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and set the units in stock to be 200, I believe we've done before, and that's just not working; let me try that again.

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So 100 and Tab, and it changes back, and then 200 and Tab, and it changes back.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, so that's not working correctly. So let's close the running form,

29
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and then come back to our code. And it's not really obvious, but the problem is here when we set the DataBindings.

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So we take a look at the overloads for Add, let me just add a , here, and you can see that the IntelliSense

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
is saying that the next parameter is formattingEnabled, creates a binding with a specified control property

32
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
name, data source, data member, and information about whether formatting is enabled, and to get the data

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
binding to work properly, or the simple data binding to work properly, we need to set this to True when

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
we're working with LINQ to SQL, so that needs to be True, that needs to be True, and actually, let me just

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
copy and paste this and it will be faster, so I need to set that to True, and that to True, and then that

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to True, and then that to True. Alright, so now if we press F5, and then go to LINQ to SQL, and then go to

37
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Outback Lager, and then go to units in stock and set that to say 200, and then go to units on order and

38
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
set that to 100, and you can see those values are preserving, and then if I come over to Chang and then

39
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ipoh Coffee, and then come back to Outback Lager, those values are preserved, and if I go to say Produce,

40
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and then to Seafood, and then back to Beverages, and then back to Outback Lager, you can see that those

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
values are still there. So when you're setting up the simple data binding using LINQ to SQL entities,

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you need to make sure you set that fourth parameter to True to get the binding to work correctly.

43
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That completes the implementation of the Get operations. In the next section we'll take a look at

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
implementing Add, Delete, and Save.
