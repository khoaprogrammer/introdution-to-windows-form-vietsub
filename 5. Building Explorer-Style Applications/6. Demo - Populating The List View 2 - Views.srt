00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this demo we'll enable users to change views in the list view in our Explorer-Style application, and we'll

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
add support for the details view. So just one note before I get started, I did modify the code a little bit.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In the AfterSelect event handler for the tree view, I'm populating both the large and small image lists.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now getting back to the views, I want something in the UI that the user can use to switch between views,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and for this we'll use the Toolbar, so I'll add a label, and I'll just set this label, let me go to full

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:58,000
screen here, and I'll just set the text of the label to View, and then beside this I'll add a ComboBox,

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and I'll call this the ViewToolStripComboBox, so let me just make this a little bit bigger so we have some

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
more space here, so ViewToolStripComboBox. And in here I want to have the different views it will support,

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so I'll come down to the Items, and this will be Large Icons, Small Icons, and finally Details.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then when the user selects an item out of the ComboBox, I want to switch the view in the list view.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
To do that I'll add an event handler for the SelectedIndexChanged event, so I'll scroll down here,

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SelectedIndexChanged, and now I just need a Select statement to change the view based on what the user selected.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So if they selected Large Icons, I'll change the view to be Large Icons in the list view, Small Icons in Details.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And coming back to the ComboBox, I want to set it, so again let me get out of full screen here, when the

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
application first starts up we see large icons, because that's the default view here.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if I come over to the properties, what I want to set is the SelectedIndex, and we can't do that here in

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the Properties Windows, so I'll have to do it in the Form_Load event, and here let me just again resize this.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I want to say ViewToolStripComboBox.SelectedIndex = 0, the first item, which is large icons.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alright, so with that changed, I can press F5,

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and there's large icons, actually let me just go to some place that has a few more files in here,

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Projects, our SDI application, and then here, okay there's a few more, and then we can go to Small Icons,

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and then we can go to Details. And you notice nothing shows in Details here, and that's because we haven't

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
told the list view what columns we want to have in the details view, so let's do that now.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So coming back over to the form designer, I can click on the list view, and I believe there is a property

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
called Columns, and there's this Columns Editor here; I find it's easier to just define the columns in code,

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
so I'll do that here in the Form-Load. So we'll have three columns; one is the name of the file, one is the

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
date modified, and then the last is the size. The second parameter indicates how wide the column should be,

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the third parameter indicates its alignment. So if we run again,

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and then go find a folder, so Projects-SDI-SDI, and then switch to Details view, now we can see in the Name

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
column we have the icon and we have the file name, but we don't have the date modified or size because we

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
haven't populated these yet, and that's the last step to complete the application.

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So as I mentioned, when working with the list view and details view, this is the item information, and then

33
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
these are considered the sub-items, so I need to add the information for these columns as sub-items of the

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
list view item. So coming back to our code here, down in the TreeView1_AfterSelect, once I create the item

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to populate the sub-items. So the first thing I'll do is create a variable that gets the

36
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LastWriteTime for the file, again I've changed the file name here so let me just fix that, and then in the

37
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
first sub-time for the list view item, I put down the date and time it was last modified, so I'm going to

38
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
write out the ShortDateString and then a space, and then the ShortTimeString.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then in the second sub-item, I want to write out the size of the file in kilobytes, so I'll take the

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
file size in bytes, divide by 1024, get the ceiling of that value, and then append KB to the string.

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So with that done, now if we go to F5, and again go to our SDI application here, and then switch to details view,

42
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
we have the item information populated, but we also have the date modified and the file size.

43
00:06:09,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And with that done, our Explorer-Style application is now complete.
