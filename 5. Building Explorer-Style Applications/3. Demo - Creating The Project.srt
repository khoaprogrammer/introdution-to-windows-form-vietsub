00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this demo I want to create the project and setup the main form for our Explorer-Style application.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So in Visual Studio I'll choose File-New-Project, and then I'll choose the Windows Forms Application template,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and I'll call the project Explorer. Click OK, and then rename the name form from Form1 to ExplorerForm.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then I'll set the title to the main form to be Explorer-Style Application, and I'll resize the main form

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to take up most of the design area. Eventually I'm going to need a ToolStrip, so let's add that now, so

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that's in Menus &amp; Toolbars, and then the remainder of the interface I want to resemble Windows Explorer.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, I want to have a tree view over here, I want to have a list view over here, and I want to have some way

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to resize these two controls relative to each other.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So coming back to Visual Studio, I'll go open up the Toolbox, and then down here there is a section called Containers.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now we haven't really talked about Container controls, so let's cover that first.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me put a panel onto the form, and then let me just change the background color of the panel to something

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
other than the color of the form, I don't know it doesn't really matter, Cornsilk, there that works.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, now let me go and drag and drop some controls onto the form, so let's put a textbox on there,

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and then let's put, I don't know, it doesn't really matter, a label, and how about a button?

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, now, if I go and highlight the panel and then move it, notice that the controls move with it.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the panel is what's called a Container control, meaning that it has its own controls collection, and

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
controls you put on the container are children of the container. So the panel is part of the forms controls

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
collection, but the TextBox, the button, and the label, are part of the panel controls collection.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And again, if I move the panel they move, and if I delete the panel they go away.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In this instance we're going to use a container control called the SplitContainer.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So if I come down to Containers, here's SplitContainer, and I'll put that on my form, and here we have a

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
panel on the left side, a splitter, and then a panel on the right side, and then now all we need to do is put

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the tree view over here on the left side and dock that into the panel, and then put my list view over here

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
on the right side, and then dock that into that panel. And now I have my application, so when I press F5

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
here, if I resize, everything resizes, and I have the splitter, or I can change the relative size of the

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
preview and the list view controls. So that gives us the form layout that we want.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
In the next demo we'll look at populating the tree view control.
