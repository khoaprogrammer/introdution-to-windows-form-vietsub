The demos of this module don't require a lot of setup; the Explorer-Style interface is familiar to anybody

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
who has used Windows, so all I have is a little bit of guidance. The first is to spend some time and

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
consider if this is really the best layout for your application, and if you determine it is, then spend

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
some more time and think about how you want to present information to the user on the right-hand pane of the application.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see a lot of people use the Explorer-Style interface where it really doesn't fit, and using these

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
applications quite often felt like the proverbial square peg in a round hole.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Also, if you do feel that this layout is suitable for your application, don't assume you have to use a list

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
view on the right-hand side. In a lot of scenarios, a user control is a better choice.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now in our application we're going to build a file explorer, so the list view is a perfect choice for the

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
right-hand side of the application.
