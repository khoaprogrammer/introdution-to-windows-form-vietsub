1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this demo we'll modify our Drag-and-Drop data binding applications to use the Details view instead

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of the DataGridView. I'll start here in our DataSet application, I'll come to our DataGridView, and I'll

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
just delete it. And then I'll come over to the DataSources window, I'll pin it open, and then I'll go to

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Products, and I'm going to switch the dropdown here from DataGridView to Details view.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then for each of the properties and products, it shows you which data entry element it's going to use to show that.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So these are all textboxes and this is a checkbox. But we have some control over how this is shown.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, for example, if I don't want to show ProductID, I can click on it and I can just choose None here.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll do the same for SupplierID, and ReorderLevel, and then for CategoryID and ProductName, I want these to

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
be ReadOnly. So I'll change CategoryID to be a Label instead of a textbox, and for ProductName I'll modify

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the textbox after I've built my form. So now that I've configured the Details view the way I want it,

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can just drag products onto the form, and now instead of getting a grid, I get a set of more traditional

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
data entry controls. And now I can just clean up the layout a little bit, so I'm going to take these and

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
lasso them and just move them down a little bit. And then here I want this to be a little bit bigger,

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
this textbox; I also want it to be ReadOnly, so I'll come down to ReadOnly and set that to True.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then for the discontinued checkbox, I'll get rid of the text here, and that should be good.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So let's hit F5. So now instead of working with all the products in one big grid, I'm working with

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
individual items, and again I can use the BindingNavigator to scroll through the items, and I can go to the

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
end like we did before, and for Test 10, I've got 100, 10, and 10, let's change that to 300, 30, and 30,

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then go back one. And for Test 4 let's go ahead and delete, and then let's save our changes, and stop

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the program, run again, go to the end; there's Test 10, 300, 30, 30, and if I go back one, now we're actually

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
into an original item, not one of our test items. And if I close this program down here, and then come over

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to our LINQ example, I can do exactly the same thing. So I'll remove the data grid, open up DataSources,

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:27,000
pin the window, switch to Details view, set the CategoryID = None, set the SupplierID = None, set the

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
ReorderLevel = None, set the ProductID, oops I didn't want CategoryID = None, I wanted it to be a Label,

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's ProductID I wanted to be None. And then I can drag Product onto my form.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And notice I not only get the product information, I also get information about the associated category.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So here in the LINQ to SQL side, it picked up that there's a two-way relationship; categories have products,

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and products are associated to a category. Now in this case I don't want the category information on the

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
screen, so I'll just lasso it and delete it. And then I'll do a little bit of cleanup here, so I want

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Discontinued to be at the bottom not up there, and I want Product Name to be a little bit higher, and then

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I want Category ID to be below that, that looks good, and then I want to lasso the entire thing and then just

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
move it up over here, move this or resize that, and then set it to be ReadOnly, press F5,

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and I can get exactly the same behavior I had in my DataSet example.

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now coming back to our form designer, when I dragged and dropped the controls from the DataSources window

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
over, I got the Category here related to the Product; let's explore this a little bit further but in the other way.

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I'm going to add a new form to my project, I'll right-click and choose Add-Windows Form.

37
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And now what I'm going to do is start with Categories, so I'll go to Category and say that I want Details,

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and then I'll drag and drop Category onto my form. I'll just move these controls over a little bit, get rid

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
of this Length label and textbox, and make my form a little bit bigger, and then I'm going to go to Products

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
here, but not the product entity we used before; I'm going to go to the products associated with the categories.

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So here I'm going to say I want this in DataGridView, and then I'll drag and drop this on my form here,

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and just place it like this. And then to ensure this control resizes when the form resizes, I'll just change

43
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:20,000
its Anchor property, so this will be right, bottom, and left. Alright, so now let's examine our controls.

44
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We have the DataGridview, we have the textboxes, the labels, the BindingNavigator, we have a

45
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
CategoryBindingSource, and we also have a ProductsBindingSource. So, for the CategoryBindingSource, it says

46
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
here that the DataSource is the Category entities in our LINQ to SQL model, but for the ProductsBindingSource

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it says that the DataSource is the CategoryBindingSource, so this BindingSource is binding to that BindingSource.

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then back in the ProductsBindingSource, this is binding to the Products collection coming out of the

49
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
CategoryBindingSource. So in our LINQ to SQL model, categories are related to products by a foreign key in

50
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the database, so category entities have a products collection property, which represent the products in that category.

51
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So now if I press F5, we can see I get the, whoops sorry I need to change the startup form, so I want to use

52
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Form2, so I'll go to My Project and double-click and change the startup form to Form2, and now press F5 here,

53
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
oh and I need to change my code behind, sorry I'm not in the DataSet example, I'm in the LINQ to SQL example.

54
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So let me go back to my form, double-click here, and like before I'll create a field to represent our

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:03,000
DataContext, so Private _context As New NortwindDataContext, and then down here in Form_Load, I'll say that

56
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the CategoryBindingSource.DataSource = _context.Categories. And then if I wanted to make this form so you

57
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
could edit, I could go back to the form design, click on the Save button in the BindingNavigator, come up and

58
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:39,000
set Enabled = True, add the event handler, and then take the code we had in Form1, and just copy and paste it into Form2.

59
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And in this case, now this is not the ProductsBindingSource, it is the CategoryBindingSource.

60
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Alright, so now I can press F5, and there we go. So there's our category information, and there are the

61
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
products associated with the category. Oh, I set my anchor wrong, but that's not important.

62
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And now here if I navigate through the categories, you can see that as the categories change the products

63
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
change because we're only showing the products associated with the current category.

64
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So that's our LINQ example. We can do exactly the same thing over here in our DataSet side, so right-click,

65
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Add-Windows Form, click Add, resize the form, open up Categories, I want Details view, drag and drop that

66
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
on the form, there's my category, data entry fields are my category controls, and then go to the products

67
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:58,000
related to the categories, DataGridView, drag and drop on the form over here, and then set the Anchor.

68
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And in this case because I'm in a DataSet, the code I need in the code behind is given to me automatically,

69
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
so I can just press F5 to run, and now I'm able to cycle through, whoops again sorry, I forgot to change the

70
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:27,000
startup form to Form2. Now press F5, and now I can get exactly the same behavior I saw over on the LINQ side.

71
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And to finish up this demo, I'll create a form similar to the one we had in our earlier data binding modules.

72
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So I'll come to our DataSet project, I'll right-click, and I'll choose to Add a new form, and I'll just

73
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
resize the form a little bit, and then we'll go to our ToolBox, actually, sorry, I want our DataSources

74
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
window, and then I'll pin that. So here I want the Categories, and I want the Products, but I don't actually

75
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
want the controls right now. I just use the drag and drop to get the DataSet, the DataAdapter is all setup,

76
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll also remove the BindingNavigator. Now I'll come over to the Toolbox and I'll pin that open, and I'll

77
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:28,000
unpin DataSources, and then here in the Common Controls I want a dropdown, so we'll put a ComboBox here.

78
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then I also want a ListBox, so I'll grab that and put that over here.

79
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then what I can do is use the smart tags on these controls to hook them up to the different BindingSources.

80
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So here I'll say that I want to data bind the ComboBox, the Data Source will be the CategoriesBindingSource,

81
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
the Display Member will be the CategoryName. And then here in the ListBox, I'll say that I want to data bind,

82
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want my Data Source to be the ProductsBindingSource, and I want the Display Member to be the ProductName.

83
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then finally I'll unpin the Toolbox, come back to DataSources, change products here to Details, and then

84
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
drag and drop this over on this side of the form here, and then just move those sort of in line with the ListBox.

85
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So now when I run I should be able to choose the category out of the dropdown; that'll show the products in

86
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the ListBox, and as I scroll through the ListBox we should see the details for the selected item over here

87
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in the textboxes and the checkbox. So let's give that a shot. I'll press F5, oh and again, I need to change

88
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the startup form, so back to my project, change startup form to Form3, now press F5, and here are the

89
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Beverages, and if I switch to Produce, here are the Produce items, if I scroll through these you see we get

90
00:13:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the information over here, and then here are our Seafood items.
