Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and this module, which is part of our Introduction to Windows Forms course,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is on Visual Studios DataSources Window and Drag-and-Drop Data Binding.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The contents of this module are pretty completely described by the title.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll take a look at the DataSources Window and Drag-and-Drop Data Binding in Visual Studio and Windows Forms,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we'll see how the use of these tools could automate most of what we've done so far in terms of data binding.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Because the focus of this module is almost completely on the tooling in Visual Studio, all of the content

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
will be done via demos, which we'll move to now.
