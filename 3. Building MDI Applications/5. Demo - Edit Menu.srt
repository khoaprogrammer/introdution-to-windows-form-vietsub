00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this demo we'll implement the Edit menu in our MDI Text Editor.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If we take a look at the Edit menu, I want all of the options that were given to us automatically.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now if we look at these options, they apply to the text in the currently active child window.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So when I click on one of these, I'll need to get a reference to the form object for the active child

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
window, and then I'll need to get access to its RichTextBox control, which we called Document TextBox.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Alright, let's implement Undo. The first thing we need to do is get a reference to the active child window,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but there may not be an active child window; maybe you haven't created it yet, or maybe they're all minimized,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we need to check for that. So If Me.ActiveMdiChild isnot Nothing Then I want to cast the ActiveMdiChild

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,000
property to ChildForm to be able to access the RichTextBox, so Dim childForm = CType(Me. ActiveMdiChild,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and I want to cast that to ChildForm). And then I want to access the functionality of the RichTextBox

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
control, so that's childForm.DocumentTextBox, and then we can take a look and see, does it have an Undo method?

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It does. And if we take a look through the IntelliSense, we'll see that it also has Redo, it has Cut,

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it has Copy; so basically all the operations we want to perform in our Edit menu are available as methods

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
on the RichTextBox control. So here we want to do Undo. And then the code for the rest of the methods is

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
basically just this code calling a different method of the RichTextBox control, so let's implement all of those.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So there's Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, and SelectAll. So at this point we're ready to test out our work.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I'll get a full screen and press F5.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then I'll come over to this browser where I have the Wikipedia page for Windows Forms open, and I'll just

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
grab this text here, copy to the clipboard, come over, create a new child window, and then choose Edit and

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Paste, you can see that that got pasted into there. I can grab patterns &amp; practices, and then do Edit, Cut,

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that gets cut, come down here, Edit, Paste, and then I can Select All, and Delete, and so on.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So all the functionality we need for the Edit menu is provided for us by the RichTextBox control.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now one quick note about the C# version of this program, if I come over to the C# project, you can see here's

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the code for our Undo, so check to see is there an ActiveMdiChild? If there is then cast that, here let me

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
just get into full screen; I want to cast that to childForm, and then I want to use the functionality of

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
the RichTextBox control to Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste. But by default, the documentTextBox is not visible

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
off of the childForm. In C#, when you add a control to the form, so let's come over to our ChildForm,

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
there's our RichTextBox, the control is declared as private, which means it's internal to the form itself,

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and we can't access it outside. So what I needed to do to get the code in the form to work the way it does

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in the Visual Basic example is change this from being private to internal, and the way I did that was I went

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to the Properties Window for the control and changed the Modifier here.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So initially it was Private, I changed it to Internal. And what that did is in the Designer generated code

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
down at the bottom, it just changed the visibility modifier on the control object.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that completes the implementation of the Edit menu. In the next demo we'll implement the File menu.
