00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In an MDI application we have a main form, which contains some number of child forms, so some of the core

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
properties or methods of the main form. We need to set the IsMDIContainer property to true; that's really

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the key in turning the Windows Forms application into an MDI application.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We use the ActiveMdiChild property to get a reference to the active child form.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can use the MdiChildren property to get the collection of all child forms, and we can use the LayoutMdi

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
method to arrange the child forms. In the child form, the key property is the MdiParent; we're going to set

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that when we create the child form, to indicate obviously it's a child of the main form, and then we can

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
also use the MdiParent property throughout the life of the child form to get a reference back to our parent.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The use of these properties and methods is covered in great detail in a series of demos which we'll move to now.
