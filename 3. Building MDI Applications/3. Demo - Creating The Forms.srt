1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this demo I want to create the project and the forms for our MDI application.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So in Visual Studio I'll choose File-New-Project, and I'll choose the Windows Forms Application template,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
name the project MDI, and then press OK. Now I want the form that's given to us by default to be the main

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
form, so I'll rename it by right-clicking, choosing Rename, and then renaming it to MainForm, hitting Enter,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and not only do I want to rename the file but I want to rename the class, so I'll press Yes in this dialog.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Alright, so now I'll set the properties of the form. First off we'll resize it and make it a little bit

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
bigger, and then I want to change the title of the form, that's the Text property, this will be a Text Editor

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
application, so we'll call this guy our MDI Text Editor. And then the key property in terms of making this

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
an MDI application is setting the IsMdiContainer property to True on the main form.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So once I do that you'll notice that the background here becomes dark in color.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, so that's our main form, now let's create the child form.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I'll right-click on the project, choose Add, Windows Form, I'll call the form ChildForm, and click Add.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We'll eventually be setting the title of the form programmatically, but for now we'll just set it to New

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Document, so I'll change the Text property.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And because this form will be used to edit each of the documents in our MDI Text Editor, I need a control

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that will allow us that text. I'm going to use the RichTextBox control, so I'll open the Toolbox and pin it,

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and then I'll grab the RichTextBox control and drag it and drop it onto the form.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now I want this control to take up the entire space of the form; I can do this in one of two ways.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can use the smart tag here at the top of the control and then choose Dock in Parent Container, or I could

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
come over to the Properties Window and find the Dock property, and then set that.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So here I can dock to the top, I can dock to either side of the form, or I can dock to the entire form.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In addition to docking the control, I also want to change the name, so instead of RichTextBox1, we'll call

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:08,000
this our DocumentTextBox. Okay, so we have our ChildForm, we have our MainForm, and now we need a way to

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
create instances of the ChildForm to go inside of the MainForm. So to do that, I'll add a Menu Control.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I'll open up the Toolbox, and I will find that it's down here under Menus &amp; Toolbars, I want the MenuStrip,

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:39,000
so I'll drag and drop that on my form. And then I'll scroll over and I'll use the smart tag of the MenuStrip

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and I'll choose the Insert standard items. So let me just unpin the Toolbox, and now we can see we have a

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
File menu with some options, we have an Edit menu with some options, Tools, and Help; we're not going to use

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
all of these, but for right now the one that we want to implement is the File-New, to create a new instance

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
of the child document. So I've shown you previously that I can select a control, and then to implement one

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
of its events come over to the Properties Window, choose the Events view, and then add the event there.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But each control has a default event; it's the event that will happen most often for that control, and if you

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
want to implement the event handler for the default event, all you need to do is just double-click on the control.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So for a menu option, the most common event you'll want to handle is its Click event.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So by double-clicking on a menu option I now have the event handler for its Click event.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So when I click the File-New menu option, I want to create a new child form, so let's do that.

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I'll put here Dim childForm As New ChildForm. And then I want to indicate that this is an MDI child of

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the MainForm, so I'll put childForm.MdiParent = Me; so Me is a reference to the MainForm.

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then finally, I want to show the child form, so that's just childForm.Show.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright so that's enough to test out our work, I'll press F5.

41
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There's our MainForm, and then I'll choose File-New, to create a new child document, again File-New,

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
another new document, File-New, another new document, and so on. And in some of the characteristics of an

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
MDI Application these child documents can't move outside of the container, so I can't move them outside of

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
their parent form. When I maximize they maximize in the parent form; if I minimize, they minimize in the

45
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:20,000
parent form, and so on. So the child form in an MDI Application is really a child of the main form.

46
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So that's the core part of building an MDI Application. In the next few demos we'll flush out the menus,

47
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
we'll remove the menu options we don't need and add a few that aren't there now, we'll implement the event

48
00:06:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
handlers, and we'll add a toolbar.
