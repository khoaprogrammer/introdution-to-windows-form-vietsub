00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this demo we'll add the Window menu to our MDI Text Editor. Alright, before I add the Window menu I'm

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
going to remove the Help menu, I don't need it for this demo, so I'll click on Help and press Delete.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I'll also remove the Tools menu, again clicking on Tools and pressing Delete.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And then here I'll add the Window menu, so that's &amp;Window. The ampersand(&amp;) beside the W makes it a quick key,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but basically what that means is I can open up this menu by pressing Alt W.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then inside the Window menu, I want Cascade, Tile Horizontally, and Tile Vertically.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And notice that the menu designer has given these controls meaningful names, so we have

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
TileVerticallyToolStripMenuItem, CascadeToolStripMenuItem, WindowToolStripMenuItem, and so on.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now there's one more property that's related to the Window menu, but it's a property of the MenuStrip,

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so I'll click on the MenuStrip, and then I'll scroll down to MdiWindowListItem, and I'll set that to the

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
WindowToolStripMenuItem. So what that does, is now for the Window menu item, down here below Tile Vertically,

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
there'll be a list of all of the open child forms, and I can use that to see what the active form is, and also

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to switch between active forms. This will all be done for me by the Windows Forms Framework.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Alright, so now let's implement our event handlers. Cascade, Tile Horizontally, and Tile Vertically are all

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
about arranging the child forms inside of the main form, and there's a method on the form object we can use to

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
arrange the child forms in the way that we want. So let's double-click on Cascade to add the event handler,

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and then I'll use Me; again Me is a reference to the MainForm. So Me.LayoutMdi, and then the parameter is

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
how I want the child forms organized. So in this case I want to Cascade them.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I'll copy and paste that, and then we'll go to Tile Horizontally, paste this in, and change Cascade to

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TileHorizontal and then TileVertically, paste the code in, then change this to TileVertical.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now I'll press F5, I'll create a couple of child forms, and then choose Window.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now first off notice that we have the forms showing here below. When we get to the demo that implements

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the File menu, these documents will have unique names, so we can choose between them much more easily.

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then up here I can choose to tile the documents horizontally, so one is on top of the other, I can

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
choose to tile vertically one beside each other, or I can choose to cascade.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So that's the implementation of the Window menu. In the next section we'll take a look at implementing

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the Edit menu.
