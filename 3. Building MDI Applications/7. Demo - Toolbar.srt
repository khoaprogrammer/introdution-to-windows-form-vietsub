00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this demo we'll add a Toolbar to our MDI Text Editor application.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So in the Designer for the MainForm, I'll open the Toolbox, and then in the Menus &amp; Toolbars section I'll

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
add a ToolStrip. And then just like I did for the MenuStrip, I'll use the smart tag of the TooStrip to

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
insert standard items. So there's New, Open, Save, Print, we don't need Print, so I'll right-click on that

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and choose Delete. Cut, Copy, and Paste, that's fine, and then we don't have Help, so I'll right-click and

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
delete that, and then I'll right click on the separator there and delete that.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now that we have the buttons we want, we can take a look at the Click event handlers, and as you can imagine,

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the Click event handler for an item in the Toolbar is going to be the same as the Click event handler for an

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
item in the Menu. So if I double-click on New here,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then it's going to grab this and cut it and move it up to the top just above the Click event handler

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
for the new item in the Menu. So here you see we have NewToolStripMenuItem_Click; this is NewToolStripButton_Click.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The signature of the event handler is the same and then of course we have our Handles clause.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So what we could do is say well we already have the implementation we want for New, so let's just call this method;

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so I'll just grab this and paste it here, and then I have the same parameter, so I can just say sender, e.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And that will work, if I hit F5, and then I click New, we get a new document.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But a more elegant way to handle this is to just say that this event handler handles the Click event for

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the MenuItem, and it also handles the Click event for the ToolStripButton.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we can do this because the signature of the event handler, or basically the arguments it takes, are the same.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So now if I hit F5,

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and then click the New button, we get exactly the same behavior.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now I could repeat this process for each of the other existing event handlers for which we have a

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ToolStripButton, and that will work fine in our Visual Basic application, but it won't work in our C#

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
application, because obviously we don't have a Handles clause. So instead I'll use a technique that will

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
work equally well in both VB and C#.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I'll switch over to the Designer, and we've already got the New button, so I'll click the Open button,

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then I'll come over to the Properties Window, and I'll switch to the Events view, and then for the Click

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
event, I'll just choose the existing OpenToolStripMenuItem_Click to be the event handler for that event.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And then I'll come over to Save, and here we'll choose Save, and then Cut, Cut, Copy, Copy, and finally Paste, Paste.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So with the VB application, what that did is just do the same thing I did using the Text Editor, it just

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
added the extra Handles clause, or the extra option in the Handles clause for the existing event handlers.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In the C# project, that would modify the Designer.cs for the form, attaching the event handlers using the

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
dynamic event handling. So the last thing to do is test out our work.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's press F5, and then use New, that creates a new document; Open will open the document we had before;

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Save we can save that off to a different file name; Cut, so let me just select this text and then Cut,

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and then type in some next text, then come down, and there's Paste, and we'll assume that the Copy works correctly.

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that completes the implementation of our Toolbar, and it also completes the implementation of our MDI application.
