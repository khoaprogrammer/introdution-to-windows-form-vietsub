Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and this module, which is part of our Introduction to Windows Forms course,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is on Deployment.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Once you've completed building your application, you need some way to get it out to your clients, and with

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Windows Forms you have a few different options. For simple applications that have few external dependencies

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you can use XCopy deployment; basically you just take the contents of the bin-debug or bin-release folder,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
copy them from your development machine over to the client the machine.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For more complex applications you'll need an installer package, and here you have two options.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can go with the traditional Windows Installer or MSI; there are a few options in terms of building these;

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you can use the Visual Studio setup project if you're using Visual Studio 2010 or earlier.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This project type has been removed in Visual Studio 2012. You can use the Third-party installer Tool,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a limited edition of Install Shield comes with Visual Studio 2010 and 2012, or you can go with something

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OpenSource like Windows Installer XML or WiX. The other option for creating an installer package is to

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
use ClickOnce Deployment, and that's the focus of the remainder of this module.
