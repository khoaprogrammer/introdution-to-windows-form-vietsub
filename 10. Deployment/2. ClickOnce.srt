00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
ClickOnce is a Smart Client deployment technology that was added to the .NET framework in Version 2.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The idea behind ClickOnce is to give developers and administrators a deployment experience similar to that of

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
web applications, while still enabling a rich client experience for end users.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To install an application deployed by ClickOnce, an end user simply needs to click on a link in a website or

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
click on a file in a file share, hence the name ClickOnce. As we'll see in the upcoming demo, the reality is

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that ClickOnce often turns into click twice, or click three times, or click four times, but when the

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
ClickOnce deployment package has been signed by a publisher certificate, the installation process is

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
generally pretty simple and intuitive. One other important aspect of the installation process, users do

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
not have to have administrative rights on their machine to install applications deployed by ClickOnce.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In the upcoming demos, I'll give you a solid introduction to ClickOnce, and we'll see its core uses from

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
both the developer and the end user side. We'll see how to publish to and install from both a file share

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and a website. We'll talk about the difference between Installed applications and Launched applications,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and we'll see how to do automatic Application Updates. Now ClickOnce is one of those topics we could have

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
an entire course on, so there are several things I'm not going to be able to cover in this module, but I

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
do want to make you aware of them so you can do additional research when you start using this technology.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So what's not covered in the upcoming demos is handling Prerequisites, like the installation of the version

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
of the .NET framework or different component suites, and using the Bootstrapper to handle those prerequisites;

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
storing files on the end user's machine using Isolated storage; Security and Trust Levels; and the Deployment

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
API that's included with ClickOnce.
