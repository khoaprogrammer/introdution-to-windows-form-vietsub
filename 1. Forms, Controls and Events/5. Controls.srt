00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now that we have our Form, we'll add some Controls to build the user interface for our program.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll be using controls that are built into the .NET framework; I'm not sure exactly how many of these there

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
are, about 30 to 40 maybe, and for many applications these are the only controls that you'll need.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now if you do have a need for a control that's not in the .NET framework, there's a very large third-party

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
market out there, and you could even create your own custom controls.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The properties for controls will differ depending on what the controls do.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But because all controls inherit from System.Windows.Forms.Control, they will share some common properties.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Three of these common properties are related to positioning, and three are related to sizing.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When positioning a control, you can either set the Top and Left properties.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Top is the number of pixels that the top edge of the control is away from the top of the form, and Left is

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the number of pixels that the left edge of the control is away from the left edge of the form.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or you can set the Location property, which is a point which represents both of those values.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Similarly, when you're setting the Size of the control, you can set the Height and Width properties, or you

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
can set the Size property.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
To programmatically add a control to a form takes a few steps. First we'll create a private field for the

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
control, then in the forms constructor, we'll create an instance of the control and store our reference

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to that in the private field, we'll set the properties of the control, and then we'll add the control to the

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Controls to the collection of the form. Now let's move back to the demo, where we'll add a few controls to the form

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to build the user interface.
