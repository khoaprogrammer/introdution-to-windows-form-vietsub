00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When we compare the code-only version of our Windows Forms project to the one we just created using the

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Tools and Designers, it may appear that there's a lot of code missing.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A couple of things that might have jumped out at you, where's the code for the controls to create them and

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
set their properties? And also where's the start-up code with our main method where we use Application.Run

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to kick off an instance of the main form. Let's talk about the controls first.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We added the controls to our program by dragging and dropping them from the Toolbox onto the Design surface,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then setting their properties and events using the Properties Window.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well as we were doing this, Visual Studio behind the scenes was generating code to create the variables for

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the controls, to instantiate the controls, to set their properties, and to attach their events, and most of

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
this generated code was going into a file in your project that's actually hidden from you by default.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you have a form named MyForm, the definition of the MyForm class is in two separate files;

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
there's MyForm.vb or MyForm.cs, and that's where the code that you write goes, and then there'll also be

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
MyForm.Designer.vb or MyForm.Designer.cs, and that contains the code that's generated by Visual Studio.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So part of the class is in MyForm.vb, and the other part of the class is in MyForm.Designer.vb.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So this concept of having a single class declaration that spans multiple files is called Partial Classes,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and it's used in this case to ensure there's a clean separation between your code and the designer generated

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
codes for your forms.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Moving on to the start-up code, if you're writing your Windows Forms application in Visual Basic, this code

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is also generated for you. In fact, you get a complete custom Application object that's used instead of the

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationObject we used in our code-only example.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This custom Application object derives from Microsoft.VisualBasic.WindowsFormsApplicationBase, and is

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
accessible in your code using My.Application. We can configure the properties and events, including the

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
start-up form for this custom Application object, using the highlighted section of the Application tab of

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the project properties. If you're writing Windows Forms application in C#, the project includes a start-up

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
class that has the standard main method, and uses the traditional Application.Run that we saw earlier.
