00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When building any kind of program using Visual Studio, using its Tools and Designers, there'll be things

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that will happen that may not be obvious to you, and there'll be files that are generated that may be

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
purposely hidden from you. And while these obfuscations are done for a reason, they can impede the learning

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of a new technology. So what we're going to do over the next few sections of this module is build a

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Windows Forms application just using code. Doing so will ensure that you see and understand each of the

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
individual pieces of the program and how they fit together. In this section we'll take a look at how to

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
build a Form and show it on the screen. Creating a Form is a pretty simple process.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We just create a class that inherits from System.Windows.Forms.Form, and set its properties in the constructor.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How we show a Form on the screen will depend on whether we're talking about the start-up form, which is the

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
form that shows when the application first starts up; this is quite often also called the Main Form.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well we're talking about a secondary form. This is a form that starts up during the life cycle of the

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
program, and it will almost always show either beside or on top of the main form.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For secondary forms, we just create an instance of the form type, and then call either the Show() or

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
ShowDialog() method to display the form. Using Show will display the form modelessly; using ShowDialog will

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
display the form modally. When starting up a Windows Forms application, a little bit more work needs to be

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
done than just showing the start-up or main form. This work is done by the Application Object.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, on start-up, we'll create an instance of our Form object and pass it to the Run method of the Application Object.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This not only displays the main form, but it also tells .NET to listen in on the Windows message loop.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Recall that the .NET framework sits on top of Windows, and it's actually Windows which is getting information

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
about the user interaction with our program, so the Application Object listens in on the message loop and

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
then passes the messages Windows is getting off to the actual forms and controls we have in our .NET application.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
To close our program we can call Application.Exit; this tells .NET to stop listening on the Windows message

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
loop and close all open forms. But we normally don't have to explicitly call Application.Exit, because

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
closing the Main Form by default implicitly calls this method for us.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, that's enough information to get us started, so we can move on to the first part of the demo,

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
where we'll see how to create the Form class and show it on the screen.
