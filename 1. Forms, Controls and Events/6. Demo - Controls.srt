00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So I'm back in my Visual Studio project, and I have the code for the form open, and I want to add three

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
controls; a TextBox, a button, and a label. And in the next section, we add event handlers, we'll take the

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
text out of the TextBox and put it into the label when the user clicks the button, but for right now we'll

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
just actually create the controls. So the first thing I'll do is create a field to represent each of the controls.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Our TextBox will be called the Message TextBox, so that's Private MessageTextBox, and that'll be a TextBox.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then we'll create our label, which will be called MessageLabel, and finally we'll create the button,

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and that'll be ShowmMessageButton. Now down in the constructor, we'll create instances of each of these

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
controls and add them to the controls collection of the form. So we'll start with a TextBox,

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so MessageTextBox = New TextBox, and then we'll add this to the controls collection of the form, so that's

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Me., me is a reference to the form, and we want its Controls collection, and we want to Add in MessageTextBox.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Below the TextBox I want the button, so I'll just copy and paste the name of the button here, and we'll say

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ShowMessageButton = New Button, and then again we'll add this to the Controls collection.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And then finally, we'll add our label that will be below the button.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
(typing)

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now I need to set the properties of each of the controls, so we'll start out with a TextBox, so we'll set

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the Left property, so we'll set that = 25. So I want the left edge of the control to be 25 pixels away from

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the left edge of the form. I'm also going to set the Top property, and I'll also set that to 25, so the

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,000
top of the TextBox will be 25 pixels down from the top of the form, and then I'll also set the Width, and

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we'll set that = 200. Then for the button, I'll also set those three properties, Top, Left, and Width.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, for Left, I want this to be = to 25, so basically I want the TextBox and the button to align on the left side.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I want the button to show below the TextBox, so I set the Top property to a number higher than 25, we'll

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
increment it by 50, so the top of the button will be 50 pixels below the top of the TextBox.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then for the Width, we'll just keep it at 200. And then I want to do the same thing for the Label here.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, the Left is again 25, for the Top we'll go 50 below the top of the button, so that'll be 125, and then

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
for the Width we'll stay consistent and just set that = 200. So with this code down, we should be able to Run,

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
so let's hit F5, and now we have our form. What we don't have is any text, so I forgot to add that,

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so let's just stop this and come back down here. I want the TextBox to start out being empty.

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want the button to say ShowMessage, so our ShowMessageButton.Text = Show Message.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And when the form first shows I want the text of the label just to be Label, so we could actually see it,

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
so our MessageLabel.Text = "(Label)" in square brackets. Alright, now let's run again.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Alright, so there's our TextBox, there's our button, and there's our Label.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And again in the next section we'll talk about event handlers, where we'll take the text that's in here and

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
when we click the button, we'll put it into the label here. Alright, so just to review, we create our

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
fields to represent each of the controls, we then instantiate the controls here in the constructor,

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we set the properties, and then we add the control to the controls collection of the form.
