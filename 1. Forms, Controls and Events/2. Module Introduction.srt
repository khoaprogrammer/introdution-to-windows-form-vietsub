00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As I mentioned previously, this module is on Forms, Controls, and Events.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this module we'll examine these three key pieces of the Windows Forms framework, by building a Windows

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Forms application using only code. And then once we have a solid understanding of how Forms, Controls,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and Events work, we'll rebuild the application using the Designers and Tools Windows Forms that are built

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
into Visual Studio, and we'll see the code that Visual Studio generates, the files where it places that code,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and how it organizes our project.
