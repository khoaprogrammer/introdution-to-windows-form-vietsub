Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and thank you for choosing to watch Introduction to Windows Forms.
chào các bạn , đây là Rob , và cảm ơn các bạn đã chọn xem phần giới thiệu winform

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This module will introduce the course, and then move on to cover the three main topics for Windows Forms
modulm này giới thiều về khóa học , và rồi sẻ học hết 3 chủ đề chính của winform 

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
applications, Forms, Controls, and Events.
những ứng dụng , form , controls , và sự kiện

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Just a couple notes before we get to the discussion of Windows Forms.
có 2 chú ý trước khi chúng ta thảo luận về winform

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Developers viewing this course are assumed to be reasonably familiar with either VB or C#, and with the use
những developer xem khóa học này thì đãm bảo sẻ hiểu biết về VB or C# và việc sử dụng
6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of Visual Studio. I've recommended a few courses you can use to brush up on these skills if you feel you
visual stdio , tôi đã đưa ra 1 vài khóa học , bạn có thể sử dụng để đánh bóng những skill nếu bạn cảm thấy

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
need to do so.
bạn cần thiết để làm vậy
8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The demonstrations in this course will primarily be done in Visual Basic.
những minh chứng trong khóa học này sẻ là đk hoàn thành trước trong VB
9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm only going to be showing C# examples where there is a significant difference between what needs to be
tôi chỉ hiển thị vi dụ về c# , nơi có 1 sự khác biệt quan trọng giữa cái gì thì cần đk
10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
done in C# and what was done in VB. However, the downloadable code samples have complete solutions in both languages.
hoàn thành trong c# và cái gì đk hoàn thành trong VB , tuy nhiên những ví dụ code có thể download đã đk hoàn chỉnh trong cả 2 ngôn ngữ 
11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
With that housekeeping complete, we can now move on to the topic for the course.
bây h có thể tới khóa học
12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Windows Forms is a combination of classes in the .NET framework and tooling in Visual Studio that enables you
winform là sự kết hợp những class in .net và những công cụ trong VS mà cho phép bạn
13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to build traditional Windows applications. Windows Forms has been part of .NET since the beginning,
xây dựng ứng dụng form truyền thống , winform là thành phần của .net ngay từ lúc đầu
14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but its evolution really ended with the .NET framework 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008.
nhưng sự phát triển thực sự của nó đã kết thúc với .net 3.5 và VS 2008 ( thôi mấy cái giới thiệu ,mình chẳng dịch đâu , lâu la, mất thời gian )
15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is in some ways a good thing; as Kate Gregory puts it, Windows Forms is in the "Safe Zone," meaning it's

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
not continually evolving like many other .NET framework technologies, so the skills you had five years ago

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
still apply today. But in some ways it's a bad thing, because Windows is evolving, and Windows Forms isn't.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One example of this that we'll see in the course is that there are no controls in Windows Forms that enable

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you to add a ribbon to your application. So like any other technology, there are pros and cons to using

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Windows Forms, but if you're going to build applications that have tight integration with Windows, I think

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Windows Forms is still the most productive way to build those applications.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This course is made up of 10 modules. This module is on Forms, Controls, and Events.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll discuss the contents of this module in more detail in just a moment.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The next module has some additional information on Forms and Controls.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Here we'll cover some specifics about the Form lifecycle, the use of dialogs, menus, toolbars, and user controls.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The coverage of these topics is required setup for the next three modules, where we'll build three

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
applications from start to finish. First we'll build a Multiple Document Interface Application, then we'll

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
build a Single Document Interface Application, and finally we'll build an Explorer-Style Application.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The next four modules focus on the Data Binding features of Windows Forms and Visual Studio.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We'll see an introduction to Data Binding, we'll take a look at Data Binding to DataSets, Data Binding to a

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
LINQ to SQL model, and then finally using the DataSources window and the Drag-and-Drop Data Binding features

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
included in Visual Studio. I'd just like to mention at this point that these four modules cover Data Binding.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now I will include some material that introduces ADO.NET, and DataSets, and LINQ to SQL, but the focus is on

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Data Binding, not the data access technology. The final module in the course covers Deployment options,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
with a specific focus on ClickOnce.
