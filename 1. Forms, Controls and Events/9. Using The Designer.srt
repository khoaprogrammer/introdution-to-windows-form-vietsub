00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now that we've seen how to build a simple Windows Forms application using code only, let's take a look at

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
how we can build the same application using the Windows Forms Tools and Designers.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this section we'll take a look at the process of building the application, and then in the next section,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we'll take a look behind the scenes, and see some of the things that happen that may not have been

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
immediately obvious to you. To create a new Windows Forms application using the Designer, we'll create a

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
new project based on the Windows Forms application template. We'll be given a form by default.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We can drag and drop controls from the Toolbox onto the visual Designer for the form, and then we can set

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
properties of the form and properties of the controls of the form using the Properties Window.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then we can create the shells for event handlers Sub routines, and attach them to events using the Events

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
view in the Properties Windows. And then finally, we can write the code behind the event handlers.
