1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now I want to build the same program we built previously, but this time using the Windows Forms Tools and Designers.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So in Visual Studio, I'll choose File, New, Project, and then in the Windows section, I'll choose the

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Windows Forms Application template. I'm going to name my project Designer, and then click OK.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This project template gives us a form by default, and this form has two views; it has the design view, and it

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
has the code view. I can switch to the code view by right-clicking and saying View Code.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, I don't want my class to be named Form1, I want it to be called MyForm, so I'll come over here in the

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Solution Explorer, I'll right-click on Form1.vb, and choose Rename, and I'll rename it to MyForm, hit Enter,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and it's saying I'm renaming the file that contains the class definition, do I also want to rename the class,

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and I do, so I'll click Yes, and notice now my Class has been renamed to MyForm.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now I want to set some properties of the form, but instead of doing that in code in the constructor,

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll come over to the Designer, and I'll click on the form, and then I can set properties over here in

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the Properties Window. So, for example, if I want to change the title of the form to MyForm, that's the Text

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
property, so I'll just change this to MyForm, hit Enter, and notice that that change gets put over here.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then if I want to resize the form I can come over to size, and instead of 300,300 let's make this 500,430

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and hit Enter, and now you can see that my form is resized. With the form properties set, I can now add the

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
controls to the form, so I'll do that by opening up the Toolbox, and I'll pin the Toolbox open, and now I can

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
drag and drop the controls from the Toolbox over here onto the form design surface.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, I want a TextBox, I want a Button, and I want a Label. Once I have the controls on the form, I can unpin

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the Toolbox to give me more space here on my Designer, and then I can drag and drop the controls around.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I want the TextBox to be up here. Now notice as I'm dragging I'm getting these snap lines, the Windows

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Forms Designer gives us snap lines so that we can align and resize controls to be similar to each other,

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it also give us snap lines to help us conform to the Windows look and feel guidelines.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, for example, if I take the button and I move it out below the TextBox, you'll see that I get the left and

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
right snap lines, but I'll also eventually get a small snap line in between the controls.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is saying that these controls meet the standard Windows Forms guidelines in terms of space between

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the two controls. Also, if I move the TextBox up here towards the top left, notice there's a snap line here

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to the left, and eventually there'll be a snap line near the top. So again, this is indicating that this

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
control is now positioned using the Windows Forms guidelines in terms of how far the control should be from

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the top of the form, and how far it should be away from the left of the form.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now in this particular case I'm not going to follow the guidelines exactly, because I want the properties of

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the controls to be the same as they were in our previous example. So I'll start out with a TextBox,

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll click on it to make sure it's highlighted, and then come over to the Properties Window; you can see this

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
dropdown at the top is indicating we're setting properties for the TextBox.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want the name of the TextBox to be MessageTextBox, so I'll set the Name property.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want the Left and Top to be both 25, so I'll scroll down here, and notice there's no left, and if you

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
scroll down to the Ts, there's no top, and by the way, I'm showing these in alphabetical order, I've done

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that by clicking the alphabetical option. If you're not seeing them in alphabetical order, you probably

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
have your properties organized by category. I just find it's easier to find things if you sort them alphabetically.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So anyways, you won't find Left and Top in here, but you will find Location.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then underneath Location we have X and Y; this is our Left and our Top, so I want these to be both 25,

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
so I'll set these to 25 and then 25. And then finally, I want the Width to be 200; I won't find a Width

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
property, but I will find Size, and if I expand that, I can set the Width here to be 200.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now I can click on my button, I want to set the name to ShowMessageButton; I want to set the Left at 25,

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and the Top to 75, so I'll come down to Location, so I want the Left to be 25, and I want the Top to be 75.

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want the Width to be 200, so I'll come down to size and set the Width to 200.

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And then finally I want the Text to be ShowMessage. And then finally I'll click on my label, I want the name

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of the label to be MessageLabel. I want the Position to be 25 and 125; I believe it is, so I actually can

48
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:29,000
just set this by the location, so 25,125. And I want the Width to be 200, so I'll just set the Width to 200.

49
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And notice I typed 200 and hit Enter, but nothing changed, and that's because the label actually has a

50
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
property called AutoSize, and I want to change that, so I'll come up to AutoSize, set this to False, I want

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
take explicit control over that, and then now come back to size, and there you can see now my Width is set to 200.

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then finally, I want to set the default Text to be Label in square brackets the way we had it in our previous example.

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And now I want to add the event handler for the button, so when I click the button the text from the TextBox

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
gets put into the label. So over here in our Properties Window, right now we're showing the properties

55
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because this option is selected. If I want to switch to the Events view, I'll click the little lightning

56
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
bolt, and now we can see the different events for the button. And if I want to add the event handler for the

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Click event, I'll make sure it's selected, and then over here in this space I'll just double-click.

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So here's our event handler Sub routine; notice it has the signature we saw before, sender As Object,

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
e As EventArgs, and it's handling the ShowMessageButton.Click, or the Click event for the ShowMessageButton.

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So now if I type in the same code we had before, so MessageLabel.Text = MessageTextBox.Text, and then hit F5,

61
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and then type some text into the TextBox, and then click the button, we can see that the text from the

62
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TextBox gets transferred over to the label. So functionally our application is the same, but the code that

63
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we see for the form is greatly reduced from what we saw earlier. Now all the code we wrote earlier, at least

64
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
similar code, is there in the project, it's just not being shown to you or made obvious to you.

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We'll explore this further in the next section.
