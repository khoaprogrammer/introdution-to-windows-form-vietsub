00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this demo we'll create the project and the form for our SDI application.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So in Visual Studio I'll choose File-New-Project, and then I'll choose the Windows Forms Application template,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we'll call our project SDI, click OK, and then for the form that's given to us we'll rename this to DocForm,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so right-click on the Form-Rename, and then DocForm, press Enter; we want to rename both the file and the

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
class, so we'll choose Yes here. We'll make the form a little bit larger, and we'll change the title of the

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
form to New Document. And then what we want to do is go over to our MDI application; I have the main form

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
open, and I want to copy the menu and the toolbar from the form here to the form here.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In our SDI application there will be no main form, so each of the document forms has its own menu and toolbar.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'll come over to MDI, I'll click on the Menu, copy that to the clipboard, come over here and paste.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And then I'll come back to the MDI application, click on the toolbar, again copy, and paste.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then finally I want a RichTextBox control to take up the remainder of the form, so I'll come over to

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Common Controls, grab the RichTextBox, drag and drop it on the form, and dock it, and then rename it to

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the DocumentTextBox. Alright, so at this point I have a program I could execute; I can click the Start

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
button and we'll see we get a form here; obviously it doesn't do anything yet.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But it's also not an SDI application. We need to configure the properties of the application object,

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and we'll see that that's very simple to do in VB because of the application framework; it takes a little bit more code in C#.
