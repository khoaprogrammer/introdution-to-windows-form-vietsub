00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this demo we'll implement the File and Edit menu options in our SDI application.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we've already added the menu in the toolbar, but we haven't implemented any of the event handlers yet,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so if I go over to the MDI application, again there are a lot of similarities here, so all I'll do is just

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
go and copy and paste all of the File and Edit event handlers we had; see Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, SelectAll,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
okay that would be those, and then come over here and paste those in; let's paste them above our CreateForm function.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And now let's go and fix up their implementations. Okay, so for File-New, we have our CreateForm method,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so I can just call that, and then for Open, we still want to show the OpenFileDialog; when the user clicks OK

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we want to put the contents of the file that they chose, let me go into full screen, into the DocumentTextBox

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:41,000
of the current form not a new form. So that would be Me.DocumentTextBox.LoadFile, and then Me.Text = dialog.FileName.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For Close we're going to close the current form, so that will be Me.Close.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For Save we don't need to get the ActiveChild form, we're going to save the contents of our DocumentTextBox,

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so let's just go and remove that If statement that surrounds this, and then here again this changes from

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:20,000
ChildForm to Me. Since there isn't a MainForm, we'll remove the Exit menu handler or Exit menu, so let me

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
just remove the event handler here, and then go back to the form and just get rid of this separator, and then

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
get rid of the Exit menu. So that completes the File menu, and now we should be into the Edit menu.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And here again we don't have to worry about the ActiveMdiChild, so let's just delete that and that, and then

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it's just Me. So I'll just grab this and come down here, paste that in, change Undo to Redo, and then do

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the same for Cut, Copy, Paste, and then finally SelectAll. Now in VB, because we have the handles clause on

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
our event handlers, our event handlers will be attached to the events automatically.

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In C# you'll have to go back to the form, click on each of the events, and then using the Events view here,

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
go and attach them. So now if we hit F5, then we can create a new document using the toolbar, we can create

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
a new document using the menu, we can open one of the files we had before, we can save, here I'll save over

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
top of one of the other documents, we can close the form, so come over here File-Close, we can select all

24
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the text, we can cut, undo that cut, we can redo that cut, we can paste, we can copy, and then we can paste again.

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So that's the implementation of the File and Edit menus. For the Window menu we're not going to have

26
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cascade, Tile Horizontally, or Tile Vertically, but we do want to have the dropdown which shows all of the

27
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
open windows and allows us to switch between them. Now because we're in an SDI application and not an MDI

28
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
application, we won't get that functionality automatically; we'll have to write some code in an event handler

29
00:05:10,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to do that, and that will be the next demo.
