Now that we've seen how to show simple dialogs using the built-in functionality of the .NET framework,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
let's take a look at how to build Custom Dialogs. You create a custom dialog as you would any other Windows form.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You add the form to the project, you add controls to the form, you set their properties, and add their event handlers.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There are just a few additional properties you need to set to make your form look, feel, and behave like a dialog.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first of these is the FormBorderStyle, which you'll want to set to FixedDialog; this changes the visual

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
style of the border and disables resizing of the form.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Next you'll want to set the ControlBox property to false; this removes the minimize, maximize, and close

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
buttons in the title bar of the form. And then finally you'll want to set the Accept and Cancel buttons.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Setting one of the buttons on the form to be the AcceptButton means that if the user presses Enter,

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that's the same as them clicking the button. And setting the button to be the Cancel button means that if

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the user presses the Escape key, that's the same as clicking the button.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then finally, when the user does click one of the buttons, you want to set the return value for the dialog.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can do this in one of two ways; you can do it in the event handler for the button click, or if the only

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
thing you want to do when the user clicks the button is set the return value, then you can use the

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
DialogResult property of the button. One important thing to note is as soon as you set the DialogResult property of a

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
dialog, the dialog will close. So if you're doing this in the event handler, make sure that setting the

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
dialog result is the last line of code in the event handler Sub routine.
