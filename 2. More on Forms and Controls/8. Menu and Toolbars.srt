00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this section we'll take a look at Menus and Toolbars. We'll start by looking at Menus.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The menu is implemented by the MenuStrip control, and the menu items are implemented by the

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
ToolStripMenuItem controls. Once you've added a MenuStrip to your form, you can add and edit items inline.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Once you've added the items you want, you can set their properties and handle their events using

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the Properties Window. The three key properties of a menu item are the Text, Image, and ShortCutKeys.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When setting the text, which is the caption of the menu item, you can prefix one of the characters with ampersand (&amp;).

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This makes that character the quick key, meaning that the user can either open the menu if it's a top level

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
menu, or select the menu item if it's a child by using the Alt key plus the quick key.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can also assign a ShortCutKey to a menu item. This is generally something in combination with the Ctrl key,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but that's not required. And when a menu item has a ShortCutKey, you can run the event handler for that menu

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
item anywhere in the application using the ShortCutKey combination.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And finally, you can associate an image with the menu item using image property.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Commonly used images are available in the Visual Studio image library.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For Visual Studio 2010 and earlier, this comes as part of the install for Visual Studio; for Visual Studio

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
2012 it's a separate download.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Most applications that have a Menu will also have a Toolbar; this is another way to get quick access to

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the menu functionality. We can add a toolbar to our form using the ToolStrip control.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The most common control you'll add to a ToolStrip is the button, or more specifically the ToolStrip button,

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but you can also add Labels, TextBoxes, ComboBoxes, ProgressBars, and more.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One thing to note about the controls in the ToolStrip is they're actually a wrapper around the controls

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we normally use. For example, you could add a ComboBox to the ToolStrip, or more specifically a ToolStripComboBox,

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and this is just a wrapper around the ComboBox. So many of the properties and events of the ComboBox are

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
surfaced by the ToolStripComboBox, but not all of them. So sometimes you'll need to get access to the

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
underlying control, and each of the different ToolStrip controls has a property which gives you that access.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now while I've been talking about Menus and Toolbars, you may have asking yourself, what about the Ribbon?

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Many applications today use the Ribbon instead of Menus and Toolbars.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There are no Ribbon controls in the .NET framework, or more specifically Windows Forms, so we're not covering

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it in this course. However, you do have options if you want to use the Ribbon.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Several of the third-party control suites include Ribbon controls, and there's also a Windows Forms wrapper

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
around the unmanaged functionality available from the Windows SDK.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is a CodePlex project you can find at windowsribbon.codeplex.com.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now I don't want to spend too much time on what we're not covering, so let's get back to what we are

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
covering, which is a demo of the introduction to Menus and Toolbars.
