In this section we'll take a look at building User Controls. A User Control is a _____ control, in other

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
words it's a control that's made up of other controls. And the process of building a user control is very

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
similar to the process of building a form. You have a design surface, you drag and drop controls onto the

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
design surface, you set their properties, you handle their events.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The advantage of working with user controls is that you can easily consolidate common UI and associated code behind.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now one important thing to note about user controls is that they can only be used in the project where they're defined.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you want to build a library of controls that you can use in multiple projects, then you're looking at

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Custom Controls, which is a more advanced topic and one we're not going to cover here.
