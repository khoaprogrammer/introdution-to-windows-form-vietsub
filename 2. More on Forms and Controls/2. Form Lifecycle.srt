00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the last module we talked about events, but we focused on events for controls.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Forms also have events; most of these events relate to user interaction, for example, the user clicks on a

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
form, moves it, resizes it, and so on. But some of these events are related to the Lifecycle of the form,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and it's on these events that we'll focus in this section. The first pair of events we'll examine is

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Load and Shown. Load fires after the constructor for the form is run, but just before the form is shown on

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the screen, and Shown is fired after the form has been shown on the screen.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The load event is the event we'll handle for the form most often by far; it's generally used to populate the

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
data for controls and do any kind of conditional formatting. The form load event handler we see on the slide

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is from a project we'll build later on in the course. The event handler we have in the upcoming demo is much simpler.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The next pair of events is Activated and Deactivate; these fire when the form gets focus and then loses focus.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We generally use these events to start and pause any Realtime processing.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the final pair of events is Closing and Closed; closing fires just before the form is closed, and can be

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
cancelled and closed fires just after the form has been closed. In the demo we're about to see, we'll

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
implement the form load event, and then in the demo for the following section, after we talk a little bit

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about dialogs, we'll see the implementation of the closing event and how to cancel the form closed.
