00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this demo we'll take a look at working with Menus and Toolbars.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So here I have a freshly created Windows Forms project, and let's add a Menu, so I'll come over to the Toolbox,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then in Menus &amp; Toolbars, I'll drag and drop a MenuStrip control onto my form.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And as I mentioned in the slides, I can add the items inline here in the Designer.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's add a File Menu, so that's &amp;File, and putting the ampersand(&amp;)character beside the F character means

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that F is now the quick key, so I can open up this menu by pressing Alt F.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And now let's add some standard items under File, so &amp;New, &amp;Open, and now I want Save, but I want a separator

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:13,000
between open and save, so I'll put the - key and press Enter, and then &amp;Save Enter, and then Save &amp;As, Enter, and so on.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And if I wanted to add an Edit Menu, I could come up to the top and add &amp;Edit, and then below add its

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
children, and then put Tools, and add its children, and so on. Alright, so let's come back to the File Menu

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then for the menu items inside of the File Menu, I can add a shortcut, and I can add an image.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But before I do that, I want you to notice the names the designer has given the controls, so this is the new

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
ToolStrip menu item, this is Open, this is Save, this is Save As.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So instead of using the standard convention where it's ToolStrip Menu item 1, ToolStrip Menu item 2,

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the designer has given the menu items meaningful names. Alright, so let's come back up to New, and let's set

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
it's ShortCutKey; normally that's Ctrl N. So, I'll come in the Properties Window and scroll down to

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
ShortCutKeys, and then here I'll open up the Designer, and I want this to be Ctrl N, so I'll click Ctrl,

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then under Keys I'll select N, and that's right there. And I also want to associate an image with this menu item.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can get commonly used images in the Visual Studio Image Library.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you're using Visual Studio 2012,

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this is a download, so just do a search for Visual Studio 2012 Image Library, and download this.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you're using Visual Studio 2010 or earlier, this comes as a Zip file with the product installation.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright, I've downloaded the Visual Studio 2012 Image Library; I put it in My Documents under Visual Studio 2012;

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
here's the Image Library, and it comes with lots of images. So the common ones here are in Actions, and you

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
have these as bmp files, icons, png files, and if you go over to png files, we can scroll down here; I don't

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
know, let's find Save, so there's the Save icon.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And notice it's the black and white icon, so this is the Visual Studio 2012 sort of black and white colorless theme.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you want the colored icons you can find them in the archive here; and what I've done to save time is I've

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
just gone throughout these folders and grabbed the images we're going to use in the demos.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I have the standard Edit, Cut, Copy, Paste, I'm using the colored ones here, I have things like Open,

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
New, this one called Document, and so on. So we'll use these. So I'll copy this path to the folder,

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and then come over to Visual Studio, and then let's go find the Image property, and then open up to the Designer here.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And when I import an image, I have a choice of storing it in a Project Wide Resource file or a Form Specific

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Resource file; I'll use the one that's Project Wide, so I'll click the Import button, and then put the path

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
into the folder I mentioned, and then let's bring in the Document I'll be using that for New.

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So click OK, so now we can see we have the New image, and then come over to Open, and then go to its image,

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Import, and then Open here, click OK, and then go to Save, and then find Image, Import, Save, and click OK.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So that covers adding a Menu and Menu Items to your form. Now let's take a look at adding a Toolbar.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I'll click on the form, and I'll come back over to Menus &amp; Toolbars, and I'll add a ToolStrip control.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And as I mentioned on the slides, we can add several kinds of controls to the toolbar; the most commonly

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
used are buttons. So let's add a button for New, let's add a button for Open, one for Save, then let's add

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
a separator, and then here we can put Cut, Copy, and say Paste. So here are the buttons, let's configure

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
this one for New. Now we didn't get a meaningful name here, so I need to rename this to the new ToolStripButton.

44
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then I want to set its image, so let's scroll down here to the Image property, and click on here,

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and we'll use the Project resource file, and New was Document, so we'll click OK, and that's really all we need.

46
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I could set the text, so down here I could set this to be New, but for a button we don't normally use the caption.

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But what you could set, which is valuable, is the ToolTipText, which shows when the user hovers over the

48
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
button, and we can set that to be the same as the text. And with that done I could now go do the same thing

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
for the other buttons, but I think you get the idea. In this demo I'm not going to show you how to use the

50
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
other kinds of controls on the ToolStrip, but in later demos we will see the use of the ComboBox.

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright, so the last thing to cover is adding events, so let's add an event for the New menu item; so I'll

52
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
click on that, and then I can come over to the Properties Window, switch to the Events view, and then add

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the Click event handler. So let's do something simple, let's just put up a MsgBox("You clicked New"),

54
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and then come back over to the Designer, let's press F5, and then click File, New, and there is our message box.

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And then now that we have the event handler for the menu item, we also want to associate the same event

56
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
handler for our toolbar button, so I can click on it, and then come over to the Properties Window, and then

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
instead of adding an event handler here, I'll select the one that we already have.

58
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The ToolbarButtons Click event handler and the ToolStripMenuItem Click event handler have the same signature

59
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
so we can have the same event handler handle both events. So now if I press F5, and click the button in the

60
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
toolbar, you can see we get the same result. So that's the basics of using the menus and toolbars.

61
00:08:07,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We'll see more on their use in the demos throughout the rest of the course.
