00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this section we'll take a look at working with Dialogs. Dialogs are forms that either provide information

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to the user or request information from the user. Dialogs are almost always modal, meaning that you can't

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
switch from the dialog to the other forms on the application; the only way you can get back to the other

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
forms is by closing the dialog. Windows Forms includes several dialog types we can use; we'll see the use

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of MessageBox in the upcoming demo, and we'll see the use of the OpenFile and SaveFile dialogs in a demo

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
later on in the course. We could also create our own custom dialogs; we'll see this in the next section.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To show a simple dialog on the screen, we can us VB's MsgBox function or we can use the Show method of the

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
MessageBox type that's in a System.Windows.Form namespace. For more complex dialogs, we'll create an

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
instance of the dialog type and set its properties, and then we'll display the dialog using the ShowDialog

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
method of the form type. The ShowDialog method is expected to return a member of the DialogResult enumeration.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This value represents the button the user clicked to close the dialog.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So taking a look at the snippet on this slide that uses the SaveFile dialog, when the dialog closes, we check

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to see whether or not the user clicked the OK button, and then if they did, we save the contents of the

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
RichTextBox to the file the user selected in the dialog. The name of that file is exposed through the file

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
name property of the dialog type.
