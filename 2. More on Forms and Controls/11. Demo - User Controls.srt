00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this demo, we'll take a look at working with user controls. So here's the project we'll be using,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and I've done a little bit of setup. I've added a class called Person; this class has FirstName, LastName,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and Age properties, and then in the load event for the form, I've created an instance of Person and set the properties.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And now what I want to do is create a user control that will work with the person data.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I'll right-click on my project and choose Add, User Control; I'll call this the PersonControl.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And here we have the design surface, and we work with this just like we would with the form.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let me resize it for now, and then open the Toolbox, and I want three TextBoxes, so 1, and then I'll

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
just copy and paste 2 and 3, and then I'll move these guys around a little bit.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then I want three labels, so there's our Label, and then again just copy and paste a couple more,

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and then now I can format the form a little bit. Okay, so this label's text will be First Name, and then this

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:49,000
TextBox will be called the FirstNameTextBox, and then I'll set the similar properties of the other controls,

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and then come back to the video. And then I'll just move these controls a little bit, so I'm just going to

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
lasso all of them, they can go up into here, and then I'll resize the control to just take up that much space there.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now we'll add the code for the control, so I'll right-click on the design area and choose View Code, I'll

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
unpin the Toolbox, and then I'll create a Person property here, so I'll use the Property code snippet,

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and the name of our field will be _person, and this is of type Person, and the name of our Property will

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
also be Person, and again this is of type Person. And then in the Get I will return _person, but before I

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
do that I want to make sure that the values in the TextBoxes are reflected in the person object, so that

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:12,000
would be _person.FirstName = FirstTextBox.Text and _person.LastName = LastNameTextBox.Text and _person.Age =

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:29,000
CInt(ageTextBox.text). And then in the Set I'll do the reverse, so that'll be FirstTextBox.Text =

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:57,000
value.FirstName, and LastNameTExtBox.Text = Value.LastName, and AgeTextBox.Text = value.Age.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And for our simple demo that's sufficient, so now let's come over to the form,

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and what I want to do is put a person control onto the form. So if I go to the Toolbox and then go up to

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the top here, what I want to do is have the PersonControl show up over here in the Toolbox.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And the way I can get that is by building the project. So, I'll do Ctrl Shift B to build the project,

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and then sometimes you need to Auto Hide and then reopen the Toolbox for this to show up; there we go,

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
there's our PersonControl, and then drag and drop that onto the form.

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I can move it around, I can put it with other controls; it's just like any other control.

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And then over here in the form, what I want to do is just say PersonControl1.Person = p.

30
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then to show we're getting the values of the TextBoxes, actually let's just come back here and then put

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
down a button below this here, and then in the button Click event handler, let's write out the last name.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, MsgBox(PersonControl1.Person.LastName). Alright, so let's press F5 to test out our work.

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So there's our form with the person data, and right now if I click the button you can see the last name is

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Windsor, and then if I change the last name to Smith and then click the button, you can see we get that value there.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So the process of building a user control is very similar to the process of building a form; it allows you

36
00:05:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to consolidate commonly used UI and logic in one place.
