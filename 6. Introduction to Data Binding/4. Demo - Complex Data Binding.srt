00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this demo we'll take a look at complex data binding; specifically we'll be binding our category and

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
products data to a ComboBox and to a ListBox. I'll start by adding a ComboBox; we'll use this to show the

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
names of all the categories, so ComboBox, and I'll put that up here, make that a little bit bigger, I'll set

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the Name property to CategoriesComboBox, and I'll set the DropDownStyle to DropDownList.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The default style is to act as a ComboBox where you can show a list of items, but you can also type in your

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
own values in the TextBox. By setting the DropDownStyle to DropDownList, we only see the items we add

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
through the data binding. Now we'll add the event handler for the Form_Load event, and we'll populate the ComboBox.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So I'm going to have a field here, we'll call this guy _source, and that will be a New ObjectSource, and then

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
here in the Form_Load, we'll set the DataSource property of the ComboBox, so that's

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:42,000
CategoriesComboBox.DataSource = _source.GetCategories. And then I want to indicate that it's the Category

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
name property I want to show in the ComboBox, so we set the DisplayMember property, so that's

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:04,000
CategoriesComboBox.DisplayMember = "CategoryName". And at this point if I hit F5, there's our ComboBox,

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and there are our category names. Following the scenario I laid out in the slides, we now want to add a

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ListBox to our form, so we'll add a ListBox, and I'll put that underneath our ComboBox, and I'll call this

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the ProductsListBox, and then I'll add the SelectedIndexChanged event handler for our ComboBox,

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and then when the user selects a category, I want to go get the products that are in that category, and bind

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:54,000
them into the ListBox. So the first thing I need is the category ID, so that's Dim catId =, and what I

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
really want to do is get the category ID associated with the category that the user selected.

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now the CategoriesComboBox does have a property called SelectedItem, so I could use that to get the

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
category object associated with the SelectedItem in the category dropdown.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the CategoriesComboBox also has this property called SelectedValue, and I'm going to use that instead.

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So up here in the Form_Load, I've set the DisplayMember to indicate which properties show in the ComboBox.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The ComboBox also has a property called ValueMember, so I can say here CategoriesComboBox.ValueMember = "CategoryID".

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then now when I ask for the selected value, that should give me back the CategoryID associated with the

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
currently selected item. Once I have the selected CategoryID, I can then go get the products for that

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:18,000
category and bind them to the ProductsListBox.DataSource = _source, that's our object data source, .GetProducts,

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then pass in the catId. And then finally I need to tell the ProductsListBox that the property I want to

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
show is the product name, so that's ProductsListBox.DisplayMember = "Product Name".

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Alright, so now I can hit F5, and I get an InvalidCastException; Conversion from type 'Category' to type

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
'Integer' is not valid. Okay, so if I hover over SelectedValue here, we can see that what it's giving me

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
back is actually the category object, and if I expand that, we can see there's the CategoryID and the

32
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
CategoryName; but that's not what I wanted, I wanted the CategoryID.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So let me stop debugging and fix that issue. It turns out that to get the SelectedValue property to work

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
right, you need to set the ValueMemberProperty before you set the DataSource on the ComboBox.

35
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So if we just take this line and move it down here, and then press F5, this will work as expected.

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not sure why you have to set the ValueMember first before you set the DataSource; it just works that way,

37
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but now we can see we're showing the products that are beverages, and then I can show condiments, and I

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
can show meat and poultry, and so on.
