00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this demo I'll prepare the project we'll be using as we begin our examination of data binding.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So here I have the project we'll be using, I named it Data, I renamed the form we were given to DataForm,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I resized the form and set the title. I added two classes to represent the objects to which we'll be binding;

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
one is called Category, it has two properties and a constructor to set those properties; a class called

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Product that has seven or eight properties and a constructor to set those properties; and then finally

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
a class called ObjectSource. ObjectSource has two fields, one is a collection of category objects, and the

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:03,000
other is a collection of product objects, and then in the constructor for ObjectSource, we populate those two collections.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
ObjectSource also has two methods, one to get the collection of categories; in this case we just return the

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
entire collection, and the other is to get a collection of products.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This method takes a CategoryId as a parameter and then we do a LINQ query to get the products from that

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
category and we return the result of that query. So in our form we'll be using the result from the

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
GetCategories method call and the GetProducts method call as the data source for our controls.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're now ready to start working on our form,

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so I'll come over to the Form Designer and open the Toolbox. The first control I want to add is a ToolStrip,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
so I'll come down to Menus &amp; Toolbars and add a ToolStrip, and then I also want to add a TabControl,

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that's in the Containers section. We're going to have two views of our data, a form view and a grid view,

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll use a TabPage for each of these. I want the tab control to be docked in the remaining space in the form,

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so I'll come up to its Dock property and set that to dock to the rest of the form, and then I'll click in the

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TabPage here for the first page, and set its caption to be Form, and then I'll switch to the second TabPage,

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and then click its page designer, and set its caption to be Grid.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And then in the second page I'll go to the Data tab and dropdown a DataGridView control.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then I'll have this dock in the TabPage. I'll also rename the control to ProductsDataGridView.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That completes the preparation of the project. In the next demo we'll start a look at data binding;

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
specifically we'll look at complex data binding.
