Hi everybody, this is Rob Windsor, and this module, which is part of our Introduction to Windows Forms course,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is an Introduction to Data Binding.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this module we'll examine what data binding is and how it works.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll look at simple data binding; that's binding to controls like a TextBox, a label, or a checkbox,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
complex data binding; that's binding to controls like a ComboBox, a ListBox, or a data grid.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We'll look at the mechanics of binding to a set of objects in memory, and we'll finish off looking

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
at the BindingSource control.
